I strongly believe that constant learning is a part of our journey, and if at some point one stops the process, that person is out of the game. My constant learning in both horizontal and vertical dimensions has landed me some of the best opportunities I could have ever dreamt of, in the last few years. Coming from a strong tech background, spending most of my time learning and teaching code to my junior's in my University

Spending almost two years learning languages like Python, Java, JavaScript, and artificial intelligence, I have helped more than 500 students in teaching and assisting them with course work and helping them achieve good grades in academics. 

Social media is a tool you can use to leverage your digital identity, an identity on which only you have the control. I am a product of digital identity and strongly believe in creating an online presence.
